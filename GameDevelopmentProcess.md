## 🎯 Construction Analogy: The Game Development Stack  

Every game is built using a stack of technologies**:  

✅ Hardware – The foundation (PC, console, mobile, VR/AR devices).  
✅ Operating System – Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, etc.  
✅ Games Engineers – Experts in graphics, physics, networking, and performance.  
✅ Game-Specific Code – The logic that makes the game function.  
✅ Graphics – Visual assets, from characters to environments.  
✅ Sounds – Music, effects, and voiceovers that bring the world to life.

## 🎯 Where Do Game Ideas Come From?  
Game ideas can emerge from anywhere—real-life experiences, movies, dreams, or even random thoughts!  
Creativity is an active process, not a passive one.
