Coordinate systems

Q. How do we define models position, rotation and scale in 3d space?
 USING Multiple Vectors

- Position the displacement from the origin of the world coordinate system
- Rotation is the degree rotation around each axis 
- Scale is the scale factor on each axis

A transform is a mathematical concept which packages position, rotation, and scale together.
