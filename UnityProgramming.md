##Two methods:

- classes- are templates for creating objects
- For example- a prefab is a template game object. We can create many game objects using prefab.
- Classes are linked to the hierarchy
- child class inherits from its parent class
- A class can override its parent functionality (polymorphism)
- objects get all properties and methods that are defined in the class.
