##**Unity Programming**

[my notes]

##My Objective:
- object-oriented thinking
- understanding how games are made
- to better communicate with my team and become a part of it
- obtainable

##Two methods:
- C# Scripting within UNITY
- visual scripting

##**object-oriented thinking**
- everything is an object
- objects have properties (variables) and methods (functions)

- classes- are templates for creating objects
- For example- a prefab is a template game object. We can create many game objects using prefab.
- Classes are linked to the hierarchy
- child class inherits from its parent class
- A class can override its parent functionality (polymorphism)
- objects get all properties and methods that are defined in the class.

##**Anatomy of a C# Script**
- Script created becomes game assets (under projects in UNITY)
- Edit scripts on Visual Studio

- scripts, when attached to GameObjects, become components of the GameObjects and appear in the inspector
