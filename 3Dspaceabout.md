# Coordinate systems

Q. How do we define models position, rotation and scale in 3d space?
 USING Multiple Vectors

- Position the displacement from the origin of the world coordinate system
- Rotation is the degree rotation around each axis 
- Scale is the scale factor on each axis

A transform is a mathematical concept which packages position, rotation, and scale together.

# Understanding Materials:
Enhanced the look of my 'solar system' 3D project using materials.

# skybox:
It is a special material wrapped around the scene that represents vast beyond your world.

#Lights:
Goals of lighting: 
- Illumination - able to see the objects
- Modeling - reveal the structure of the objects
- Focus - create contrast, create light and dark areas to get player focus
- Visual Style -

Types of light - 
- direct v/s indirect
- realtime v/s backed

Game Engine Light:
- Lights have no geometry
- More lights, more processors, slow down games
- shadows negatively affect
