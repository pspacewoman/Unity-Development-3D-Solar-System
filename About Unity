Standard Unity View (Window > Layouts > 2 by 3)

1) Scene View = the editor view that allows you to
navigate the 3D world, as well as select and manipulate
3D assets in the world.

2) Game View = Upon hitting “play” in the top middle of the
screen, you’ll compile and preview the gameplay in this
view. By default the view shows the active camera.

3) Hierarchy Panel = This is a hierarchical list of objects in
the game. You can select objects, rename them, and
delete them (Shift-Delete)

4) Project Panel = This shows all the usable “assets” (files)
located in the project’s Assets folder.

5) Inspector = Allows you to view and edit the component
settings for the selected object in the Scene View,
Hierarchy, or Project Panel.
